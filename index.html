            <!--<h4>1000 hours</h4>-->
            <p>
                A common theme that appears throughout Outliers is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29" class="link"><b>"10,000-Hour Rule"</b></a>, based on a study by Anders Ericsson. Gladwell claims that greatness
                requires enormous time, using the source of The Beatles' musical talents and Gates' computer savvy as examples. The Beatles performed live in Hamburg,
                Germany over 1,200 times from 1960 to 1964, amassing more than 10,000 hours of playing time, therefore meeting the 10,000-Hour Rule. Gladwell asserts
                that all of the time The Beatles spent performing shaped their talent, and quotes Beatles' biographer Philip Norman as saying, "So by the time they returned
                to England from Hamburg, Germany, 'they sounded like no one else. It was the making of them.'" Gates ... spent 10,000 hours programming on it.
